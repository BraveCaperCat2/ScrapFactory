   "description" : "*Tycoon games go brrrr*\r\nA custom game letting people build Tycoon-like factories.\r\n\r\nI wanted to give a bit of a closure for this mod as it was very abruptly shut down and kept unlisted so no new people downloaded it. I was unhappy and quite sad to have something I was very closely working with get abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am putting this mod out here with a focus that people check out effort I've put into it. Including a behind the scenes folder where I dug up most of the prototype concept art and early models. I do hope that if people don't want to play it, they will at least check out the behemoth of motivation and effort I have done for (honestly) quite an ungrateful person.\r\n\r\n(PS to find it you have to go to mod directory \"Steam\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\387990\\3342584624\" and find folder titled \"Artistic\")",
